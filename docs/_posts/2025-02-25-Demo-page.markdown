This page demonstrates some of the inference samples input using chatTTS, F5TTS and CosyVoice2 models, and the output of Moshi, Freeze-omni, and VITA-1.5 models.

## Audio Example
Here we show three different interruption difficulty level, including easy, medium, and hard, for each TTS model.
The audio samples are generated from the following simulated conversation. <Further Inquiry> and <Topic Shift> are involved in this conversation, and the total round is 4.

```json
{
    "num_rounds": 4,
    "user": "Can you suggest a quick and easy dinner recipe? <Further Inquiry> Oh, do you know any vegetarian options? <Further Inquiry> Also, I need a dessert idea that's not too sweet. <Topic Shift> Got it. By the way, any tips on reducing food waste? ",
    "ai": "Absolutely! Try making a stir-fry with your choice of protein, mixed vegetables, and soy sauce. Serve it with rice or noodles for a complete meal. <Further Inquiry> Of course, you can use tofu or tempeh instead of meat. Eggplant and bell peppers add great flavor and texture as well. <Further Inquiry> A fruit salad with a drizzle of honey and mint leaves is refreshing and not overly sweet. <Topic Shift> Try meal planning, storing food properly, and using leftovers creatively. Composting is another way to reduce waste. "
}
```
