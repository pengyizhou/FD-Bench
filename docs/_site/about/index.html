<meta name="description" content="Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems (FDSDS) enable more natural human-machine interactions by allowing real-time user interruptions and backchanneling, compared with traditional SDS relying on turn-taking manners. However, current benchmarking lacks evaluation metrics for FD scenes, e.g., evaluating model performance under user interruption cases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive FD benchmarking pipeline utilizing LLMs, TTS, and ASR to address this gap. It assesses FDSDS’s ability to handle user interruptions, manage delays, and robustness in challenging scenarios with diverse novel metrics. We applied our benchmark to three open-source FDSDS (Moshi, Freeze-omni, and VITA-1.5) using over 40 hours of generated speech, with 293 simulated conversations and 1,200 interruptions. The results show that challenges, such as failing to respond and reply to user interruptions, for all models remain under frequent disruptions and noisy conditions. Demos, data, and codes will be released." />
