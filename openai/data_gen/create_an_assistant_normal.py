Topic Shift: Asking another question that is irrelevant to the previous question nor the response of the AI assistant; 4.

The user may start the conversation with any natural topic in real-life conversations between friends and families, e.g., Travel, Daily activities, Entertainments, Food, Health and Fitness, and Social interactions, while not limited to these topics. - Language Expression: The user's language should be as colloquial and human-like as possible.
